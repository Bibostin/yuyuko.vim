## Introduction

This is a vim/neovim color scheme.

The idea was from the color of [Yuyuko Saigyouji](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Yuyuko_Saigyouji).

So this color scheme is called yuyuko.vim !

## Big Updates

**GUI Support!**: (Beta v0.3.7) at 2023/02/26, I remembered that I forgot to add GUI support, so after an hour's work, GUI version of yuyuko.vim has came out!

**Big Fix**: (Beta v0.5.2) at 2023/04/15, I've got the time to fix many problems of the scheme, enjoy it!
